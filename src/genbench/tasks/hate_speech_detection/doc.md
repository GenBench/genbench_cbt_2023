# Hate Speech Detection

## Abstract
This project aims to go beyond the random train-test split by developing a more challenging data-splitting process 
to better evaluate generalisation performance.
We rely on a models internal representations to create a data split specifically designed for a provided model. 
We create the split by clustering the internal representations and assigning clusters to either the train or the test set.
Hate Speech is used as a testing ground for developing the splitting method.

## Examples
*Give some examples of the Hate Speech Detection.*

## Usage
*Describe how to load your task and what is required for evaluation, if anything.*

## Data Source
*Describe the data source for this Hate Speech Detection.*

## Limitations and Bias
*Note any known limitations or biases that the Hate Speech Detection has, with links and references if possible.*

## GenBench Eval card
*Describe what kind of generalisation your task is evaluating, and include a [genbench eval card](https://genbench.org/eval_cards/) for your task*.
